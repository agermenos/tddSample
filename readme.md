# Example for Test Driven Development

The following code contains both a *Java* and a *javascript* example
to implement using TDD.

The goal is to resolve the following problem, using TDD as the backbone of the solution.

 Given two numbers n and m, find their digital average.

 The digital average can be calculated only if all digits in their sum are even. To obtain the digital average, each digit of this sum should be divided by 2.

 If the digital average cannot be calculated, return -1 instead.

 Example

 For n = 273 and m = 415, the output should be
 middleNumber(n, m) = 344.

 n + m = 688. 6 / 2 = 3, and 8 / 2 = 4. Thus, the answer is 344.

 Please have fun!

 [time limit] 3000ms (java)
 [input] integer n

 Constraints:
 1 ≤ n ≤ 500.

 [input] integer m

 Constraints:
 1 ≤ m ≤ 500.

 [output] integer

 An integer value which is a middle number of the two given integer else -1 is returned.
